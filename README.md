This experiment is an antithesis to my tendency to try to write "clean" code and "good" abstractions. 
It's written in a C-style manner, with simple functions and structs, and does not attempt to be 
cross-platform from the get-go. 

The goal is to experiment with real-time rendering, networking, and AEC / BIM / CAD data.
